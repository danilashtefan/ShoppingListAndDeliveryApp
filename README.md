# ShoppingListAndDeliveryApp

# Introudction
I guess everyone at least once in a life dreamed thet
there is no need to go to the shops. With my updated shopping list the dream can become true. User will just have
to press delivery button and the driver will be able to pick up their order and bring them whatever they want. But this is not
the end of the surprises, if you would like to earn some money, you will be able to become a driver and accept
other people orders.
